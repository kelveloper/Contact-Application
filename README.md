# Contact-Application
In this code-along, we will go through the steps required to create a web page with JavaScript functionality that interacts with a web service through an API.

Specifically, we will walk through the following steps:

-Create a web page to act as the user interface (UI).

-Display a list of contacts as a table in the web page.

-Use the web page to add a new contact to the list of contacts.

-Use the web page to update an existing contact in the list.

-Use the web page to delete an existing contact from the list.

-Add meaningful user feedback for cases where the program cannot complete a task as requested.
